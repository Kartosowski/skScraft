# skScraft - BungeeCord syntaxes for Skript
skScraft - Easy to use BungeeCord Syntaxes for Skript. 
# INSTALLATION
To use skScraft you need to install some dependencies. **Skript** of course is the main one, but to make skScraft connect and communicate with **BungeeCord**, you need to upload **BungeeBridge** plugin on your **Spigot server**, and **BungeeCord Proxy**.

1. Download **[latest](https://github.com/scraft-official/skScraft/releases/tag/1.0 "Click here to download, latest release!")** release of **skScraft**.
2. Download **[latest](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungeebridge.5820/ "Click here to download, latest release!")** release of **BungeeBridge**.
3. Unzip downloaded **BungeeBridge.zip** and upload **BungeeBridge_Client** to **spigot** server, and **BungeeBridge_Server** to **BungeeCord** Proxy.
4. Upload downloaded **skScraft** to **ONLY** **spigot** server.
5. Launch **BungeeCord** proxy first, then **Spigot** server, and *change config* file of *BungeeBridge* if you need. (If you have different IP adresses of BungeeCord proxy and Spigot server in example.)
6. If you want to see some **additional information** (*about why you have <none>, when you use one of syntaxes*) go to **skScraft directory**, and set **DEBUG MODE** to true in **config.yml**. Then go back to the server and type command **/skScraft reload** in console or as a player.

------------

***Very important!** When you will use **skScraft** syntaxes, use** parasing player as text** (ex. "%player%", "%arg-1%"). The main reason of that, is parasing online player by skript, can not work correctly, if player is not connected to the same server where the syntax is used. So **always** parse **player** **as** **text**, to make it **working** without problems!

***NOT CORRECT*** -> ( *if player is connected to bungeecord network* )

***CORRECT*** -> ( *if "%player%" is connected to bungeecord network* )
